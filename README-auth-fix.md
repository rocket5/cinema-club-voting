# Supabase Authentication Fix

This document outlines the changes made to fix the authentication issues in the Cinema Club Voting application.

## Changes Made

1. **Created SQL Script for RLS Policies**
   - Created `supabase_rls_fix.sql` with proper Row Level Security policies for the profiles table

2. **Updated Signup Component**
   - Removed duplicate profile creation code
   - Added loading spinner during signup
   - Redirects to email confirmation page after successful signup

3. **Created Email Confirmation Page**
   - Added a new page that explains to users they need to check their email
   - Added route in App.js for the email confirmation page

4. **Updated Auth Service**
   - Improved error handling for profile creation
   - Added checks for valid sessions before profile operations
   - Made profile creation more resilient to RLS policy errors

## How to Apply the Fix

### 1. Run the SQL Script in Supabase

1. Log in to your Supabase dashboard
2. Go to the "SQL Editor" section
3. Click "New Query"
4. Copy and paste the contents of `supabase_rls_fix.sql`:

```sql
-- Enable Row Level Security for the profiles table
ALTER TABLE profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create a policy that allows authenticated users to insert their own profile
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own profile" 
ON profiles FOR INSERT 
TO authenticated 
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);

-- Create a policy that allows users to update their own profile
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own profile" 
ON profiles FOR UPDATE 
TO authenticated 
USING (auth.uid() = id);

-- Create a policy that allows users to read any profile
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can read profiles" 
ON profiles FOR SELECT 
TO authenticated 
USING (true);

-- Create a policy that allows users to delete their own profile
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own profile" 
ON profiles FOR DELETE 
TO authenticated 
USING (auth.uid() = id);
```

5. Click "Run" to execute the SQL

### 2. Test the Application

1. Try creating a new account
2. You should see a loading spinner while the account is being created
3. After successful creation, you should be redirected to the email confirmation page
4. Check that no errors appear in the console

## Explanation of the Issue

The main issue was that Row Level Security (RLS) policies were not properly set up for the profiles table in Supabase. This caused errors when trying to create a profile for a new user because:

1. The user was not yet authenticated when the profile creation was attempted
2. There were no RLS policies allowing even authenticated users to create their own profiles

The solution adds proper RLS policies and makes the profile creation process more resilient by:

1. Checking for valid sessions before attempting profile operations
2. Handling RLS policy errors gracefully
3. Ensuring profiles will be created on first login if they couldn't be created during signup

## Additional Notes

- If you continue to see RLS policy errors, you may need to restart your application or clear browser storage
- The profile creation now happens in the auth service, not in the Signup component
- The email confirmation page provides clear instructions to users about next steps
