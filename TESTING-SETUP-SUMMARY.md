# Testing Setup Summary

## Changes Made

1. **Installed Jest and Testing Libraries**
   - Added Jest, jest-environment-jsdom, @testing-library/react, and @testing-library/jest-dom
   - Used `--legacy-peer-deps` flag to handle dependency conflicts

2. **Created Configuration Files**
   - **jest.config.js**: Set up Jest with jsdom environment and proper configuration
   - **.babelrc**: Configured Babel for transpiling modern JavaScript
   - **src/tests/mocks/**: Added mock files for CSS and assets

3. **Updated Test Environment**
   - Fixed the Jest environment configuration by adding `testEnvironmentOptions`
   - Updated the setupTests.js file to properly mock browser APIs
   - Fixed window.location mocking to use Object.defineProperty instead of direct assignment

4. **Created Test Files**
   - Added a simple test file to verify the testing setup
   - Created a login integration test file to test authentication flows
   - Fixed Supabase client tests in `src/tests/supabase/client.test.js`
   - Fixed Authentication service tests in `src/tests/supabase/auth.test.js`
   - Fixed Auth service tests in `src/tests/services/auth.service.test.js`
   - Configured npm scripts for running different test suites

5. **Documentation**
   - Created TESTING.md to document the testing setup
   - Added troubleshooting tips and best practices

## Current Status

- Basic Jest setup is working correctly
- Simple tests are passing
- Login integration tests are passing
- Supabase client and authentication tests are passing
- Auth service tests are now passing
- Overall, 87 out of 88 tests are passing (only one test in sessions.test.js is failing)

## Next Steps

1. **Improve Test Coverage**
   - Add more component tests
   - Add integration tests for other critical user flows
   - Consider adding end-to-end tests

2. **Refine Mocking Strategy**
   - Create reusable mock factories for common dependencies
   - Improve the organization of mock implementations
   - Add more comprehensive mocks for Supabase operations

3. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Set up automated testing in CI/CD pipeline
   - Configure test reporting and coverage analysis

## Running Tests

You can run tests using the following npm scripts:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test:jest

# Run simple tests
npm run test:simple

# Run login tests
