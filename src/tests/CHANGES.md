# Changes to the Testing Infrastructure

## Overview

We've made several improvements to the testing infrastructure for the Cinema Club Voting application to make it more robust, user-friendly, and compatible with Supabase's Row-Level Security (RLS) policies.

## Key Changes

### 1. Fixed UUID Format Issues

- Updated the test data generation to use proper UUID format instead of string IDs
- Added a `generateUUID()` function to create valid UUIDs for test data
- This fixes the "invalid input syntax for type uuid" error

### 2. Added Authentication Support for Tests

- Added support for running tests with an authenticated user
- Tests now check for TEST_USER_EMAIL and TEST_USER_PASSWORD environment variables
- If provided, tests will sign in with these credentials before running
- This helps bypass RLS policy restrictions without modifying the policies

### 3. Improved Error Handling and Reporting

- Added more detailed error messages for common issues
- Added specific guidance for RLS policy errors
- Added a test summary at the end of the test run
- Improved cleanup of test data

### 4. Enhanced Environment Variable Verification

- Created a comprehensive `verify-env.js` script
- Added checks for all required and optional environment variables
- Added verification of Supabase connection
- Added verification of test user authentication

### 5. Better Documentation

- Updated the README.md with detailed instructions
- Added troubleshooting information for common issues
- Added a section on authentication for tests
- Created a .env.test.example file as a starting point

### 6. Improved Test Structure

- Added proper setup and teardown for tests
- Added better isolation between tests
- Added more robust error handling
- Added proper process exit handling

## How to Use the New Testing Infrastructure

1. Copy the `.env.test.example` file to `.env` or add the variables to your existing `.env` file
2. Set your Supabase URL and Anon Key
3. (Optional but recommended) Set your test user email and password
4. Run `npm run verify:env` to verify your environment
5. Run `npm run test:voting` to run the voting tests

## Future Improvements

- Add more tests for other parts of the application
- Add integration tests that test the UI and API together
- Add performance tests
- Add more detailed reporting of test results
